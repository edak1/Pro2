        	<h4>The first task of the state program for the development of physical culture and sports for 2007-2011 was to improve the regulatory framework, which in turn indicates the level of development of Kazakhstani sports. The decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated March 17, 2001 states: </h4>
        	<blockquote class="quote">
                <p>
                    The state of the sports base, the underdeveloped network of children's and youth sports schools, which provides the opportunity to organize classes in them only for 7 percent of school-age children of the republic, the shortage of highly qualified trainers and teachers does not allow satisfying the broad needs of the population, especially children and adolescents, in physical exercises. The lack of modern sports facilities equipped with high-quality inventory and equipment, sports reserve training centers and Olympic training centers hinders the growth of sportsmanship and the training of a sports reserve in the country. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lagging behind international standards is primarily due to the lack of a modern sports base that meets the highest world requirements today.
